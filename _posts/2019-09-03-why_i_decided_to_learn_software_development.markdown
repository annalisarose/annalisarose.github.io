I'm a millenial whose dad was, profesionally, in the vanguard of the dot com bubble. I grew up with the internet, and vice versa. Somewhere around the time I was making Sailor Moon fansites on GeoCities, I discovered OtakuWorld, a "[web site, dedicated to software influenced by and related to Japanese anime and manga](http://https://otakuworld.com/)." OtakuWorld's biggest attraction was The Big KiSS Page, which comprised a library of user-submitted digital "paper doll" games, and tutorials for how to DIY a doll at home. My first forays into programming were writing the configuration files for my own dolls.

As the web expanded over the years, I continued to dabble in coding to customize my MySpace, and later, my Tumblr, but I began to pursue software development in earnest about six years ago, when I took an intro front-end dev course at General Assembly. For my final project, I created a static webpage that mimicked the appearance and functionality of a KiSS Doll set. On the last day of class, my instructor pulled me aside to suggest I pursue coding as a career path, and that was all the encouragement I needed. I chose Flatiron School for fullstack studies because they teach Ruby in addition to JavaScript, and I'd rather learn more than less for the same price as other programs.

I would consider coding an artform, and computers to be the most versatile, powerful, and revolutionary medium yet invented. Something as small as tweaking the font on a friend's website gives me the same gratification as my creative hobbies, like digital drawing and playing piano. I clearly gravitate to screens and keyboards to express ideas, so I'm grateful to have coding as an outlet to bring my creative sensibilities into the professional sphere.
